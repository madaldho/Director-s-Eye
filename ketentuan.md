🚀 Are you ready to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the cloud?
Join us for a high-energy hackathon where Google Cloud takes center stage. This is your chance to experiment with cutting-edge AI, machine learning, and cloud technologies built to help you create, scale, and launch transformative ideas.

Tap into powerful data analytics, secure storage, and enterprise-grade security while exploring curated and public datasets. With Google Cloud’s advanced AI tools at your fingertips, you’ll have everything you need to turn bold concepts into breakthrough projects.

We're thrilled to be partnering with Datadog, Confluent, and ElevenLabs for this hackathon!
Requirements
WHAT TO BUILD
Build a new working application that tackles one of the challenges provided by one of the partners. Your submission must integrate both Google Cloud products (Vertex AI, Gemini, etc.) and the specific Partner’s technologies to deliver a compelling and innovative solution. 

Datadog Challenge: Using Datadog, implement an innovative end-to-end observability monitoring strategy for an LLM application powered by Vertex AI or Gemini.(new or reused) Stream LLM and/or runtime telemetry to Datadog, define detection rules, and present a clear dashboard that surfaces application health and the observability/security signals you consider essential. When any detection rule is triggered, leverage Datadog to define an actional item (e.g., case, incident, alert, etc.) with context for an AI engineer to act on.


Confluent Challenge: Unleash the power of AI on data in motion! Your challenge is to build a next-generation AI application using Confluent and Google Cloud. Apply advanced AI/ML models to any real-time data stream to generate predictions, create dynamic experiences, or solve a compelling problem in a novel way. Demonstrate how real-time data unlocks real-world challenges with AI.


ElevenLabs Challenge: Use ElevenLabs and Google Cloud AI to make your app conversational, intelligent, and voice-driven. Combine ElevenLabs Agents with Google Cloud Vertex AI or Gemini to give your app a natural, human voice and personality — enabling users to interact entirely through speech. You can integrate ElevenLabs’ APIs directly into your app using our React SDK or via server-side calls hosted on Google Cloud.

Please double check our Resources tab for full details of all challenges.

DATADOG
Datadog Challenge

Using Datadog, implement an innovative end-to-end observability monitoring strategy for an LLM application (new or reused) of your choice, powered by Vertex AI or Gemini. Stream LLM and runtime telemetry to Datadog, define detection rules, and present a clear dashboard that surfaces application health and the observability/security signals you consider essential. When any detection rule is triggered, leverage Datadog to define an actional item (e.g., case, incident, alert, etc.) with context for an AI engineer to act on.

You have full access to Datadog, be creative in how you leverage the platform and the telemetry you emit.

Join our webinar on December 9th - 9:00-9:45am EST to access an additional 30 days of our free trial!

Hard requirements

Provide an in-Datadog view that clearly shows your application health (e.g. latency/errors/tokens/cost), SLOs, and actionable items from the detection rules you defined.

Create an actionable record inside Datadog with clear contextual information to drive next steps. (Incident Management or Case Management)

Applications must leverage Vertex AI or Gemini as the model host.

Report your application telemetry data to Datadog (e.g., LLM observability signals, APM, logs, infrastructure metrics, RUM, etc.) using your preferred method (auto-instrumentation, SDKs, or API).

Define at least 3 detection rules in Datadog to evaluate application signals and determine when the app requires attention (e.g., monitors/SLOs).

Create an actionable record inside Datadog with clear contextual information to drive next steps (E.g. Signal Data, Runbook, context around the signal).

Provide an in-Datadog view that clearly shows application health from the relevant signals collected, detection rules status and any actional items status derived from your detection rules.

What to Submit

The modified Submission must remain substantively the same as the original Submission with the only modification being what the Sponsor and Devpost permits.

 

8. JUDGING: Each entry will be judged by a panel of experts who are employees of Sponsor, Devpost and/or Partners (“Judges”).  On or about the period between January 19, 2026 through February 2, 2026, (“Judging Period”) the Submissions will be evaluated by the Judges in the following Stages.

Stage One: The first stage will determine via pass/fail whether the Submission meets a baseline level of viability, in that the Submission includes all Submission requirements, reasonably addresses a Challenge and reasonably applies both the required data provided by Partner and Google Cloud products.

Stage Two: All Submissions that pass Stage One will be evaluated in Stage Two based on the following equal weighted criteria:

Technological Implementation

Does the interaction with Google Cloud and Partner services demonstrate quality software development?

Design

Is the user experience and design of the project well thought out?

Potential Impact

How big of an impact could the project have on the target communities?

Quality of the Idea

How creative and unique is the project?

The highest-scoring Submissions for each Challenge will be selected as the potential winners. Ties will be broken by comparing scores on each criterion in the order listed, and if a tie remains, judges will vote. If a potential winner is disqualified, the Submission with the next highest score will become the potential winner.

On or about February 5, 2026, the potential winner(s) will be selected and may be notified by telephone and/or email, at Sponsor’s discretion for Winner Verification Requirement (as defined below). If a potential winner does not respond to the notification attempt within two business days from the notification attempt, then such potential winner will be disqualified and an alternate potential winner will be selected from among all eligible entries received based on the judging criteria described herein. With respect to notification by telephone, such notification will be deemed given when the potential winner engages in a live conversation with Sponsor or when a message is left on the potential winner’s voicemail service or answering machine by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first. Except where prohibited by law, each potential winner may be required to sign and return a Declaration of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release and provide any additional information that may be required by Sponsor.  If required, potential winners must return all such required documents within two days following attempted notification or such potential winner will be deemed to have forfeited the prize and another potential winner will be selected based on the judging criteria described herein. All notification requirements, as well as other requirements within these Rules, will be strictly enforced.

 

“Winner Verification Requirement” means THE AWARD OF A PRIZE TO A POTENTIAL WINNER IS SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION OF THE IDENTITY, QUALIFICATIONS AND ROLE OF THE POTENTIAL WINNER IN THE CREATION OF THE SUBMISSION. No Submission or individual shall be deemed a winning Submission or winner until their post-competition prize affidavits have been completed and verified, even if prospective winners have been announced verbally or on the competition website. The final decision to designate a winner shall be made by the Sponsor and/or Administrator.

A Submission can win a maximum of one prize. In the event that no entries are received for a Challenge, no prize will be awarded.  Determinations of judges are final and binding.
